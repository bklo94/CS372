Prerequisites :
Make sure there are two instances of the shell on the same flip server
Make sure gcc compiler is available
Make sure python2.7 is available

ftclient and ftserver can be in different directories

Compilation instructions:
ftserver must be compiled with gcc with the command
gcc ftserver.c -o ftserver

Execution instructions:

ftserver is started with
./ftserver <portnumber1>

ftclient to list the directories is started with
python ftclient.py <flipserver> <portnumber1> <command> <portnumber2>

ftclient to get a file is started with
python ftclient.py <flipserver> <portnumber1> <command> <filename> <portnumber2>

portnumber1 corresponds to the same portnumber1 in the ftserver.
Examples

./ftserver 10456

To list the directories
python ftclient.py flip1 10456 -l 10457
To get a file
python ftclient.py flip1 10456 -g README.txt 10457

You can exit out of the ftclient or ftserver with a KeyboardInterrupt(ctrl+C)

Notes:
portnumber1 and portnumber2 cannot be the same
Please make sure the flip servers are the same for the server and client
If you have a binding port error, please choose a different port since it may be in use.
ftserver and ftclient do not have to be in the same directory to work
